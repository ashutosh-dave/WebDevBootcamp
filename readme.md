10. NextJS

There are so many other things that I might have to learn along the way, will discover new things as well. Will update this list on the go!

### Oh, along with this, I will learn about Docker and Kubernetes. Will dive deeper into how things work in the back-end. And I am curious about GoLang and Rust too, but that will take some time to get started. Current goal is strong foundation, so anything can be adaptable and is nothing more than just programming to me. Basically, I am looking forward to mastery.

Also you're about to start new internship, and that requires you to learn PHP so get back at it. Brush off your fundamentals and let's go!
